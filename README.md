# Dive into Deep Learning Exercise Solutions

A record of my Solutions To Exercises as I go through the [Dive into Deep Learning Book](http://d2l.ai/) textbook.

I adapted the structure from [greentfrapp's Deep Learning Book Notes](https://github.com/greentfrapp/deep-learning-book-notes).

Motivation: Refreshing my knowledge on Deep Learning. I used to have a past interest in machine learning but ultimately abandoned it because I realized that, as with many other people, I liked the applications of deep learning more than the theory. I would much prefer to build product. Anyhow, I will continue to improve as a web developer but machine learning will be my hobby.

I hope this will be of use to someone out there.
